## 🧠 Technical Decisions Log

### Database Strategy
**Decision:** H2 for development, PostgreSQL production-ready
**Date:** 20/08/2025
**Reasoning:** 
- H2 provides zero-configuration setup for development
- Easy to switch to PostgreSQL for production
- Allows focus on business logic rather than database setup
- Standard practice in Spring Boot development

---

### Architecture Pattern
**Decision:** Layered Architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)
**Date:** 20/08/2025
**Reasoning:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to test individual layers
- Standard Spring Boot pattern
- Scalable and maintainable

---

### Project Timeline
**Decision:** 4-week development cycle
**Date:** 20/08/2025
**Reasoning:**
- Week 1: Solid foundation with data model
- Week 2: Core business logic
- Week 3: API endpoints and testing
- Week 4: Polish and documentation
- Manageable scope for demonstration project
