## üéØ Project Overview
**Personal Library Management REST API**

- **Tech Stack:** Spring Boot 3.2.x, Java 21, H2/PostgreSQL, Maven
- **Architecture:** Layered (Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository)
- **Developer:** David Fern√°ndez Suco
- **Repository:** [mybookshelf-backend](https://github.com/DavidFernandezSuco/mybookshelf-backend)
- **Current Status:** üöÄ **Phase 3 Complete - Production Ready API**

---

## üèóÔ∏è Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Data Model ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Entity Architecture:**
- **4 Core Entities:** Book, Author, Genre, ReadingSession + 2 Enums
- **Complex Relationships:** Many-to-Many (Book ‚Üî Author, Book ‚Üî Genre)
- **Database Schema:** 6 tables with proper constraints and referential integrity
- **Business Logic:** Entity-level validation and utility methods

**Key Achievement:** Professional domain model with bidirectional JPA relationships supporting real-world library management scenarios.

---

### Phase 2: Business Logic & Data Access ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Repository Layer:**
- **4 Repositories** with custom JPQL queries for complex business requirements
- **Advanced Features:** Pagination, sorting, statistical aggregation, search functionality
- **Analytics Queries:** Book counting, yearly progress, author popularity metrics

**Service Layer:**
- **5 Services** with comprehensive business logic and validation
- **Intelligent State Management:** Automatic WISHLIST ‚Üí READING ‚Üí FINISHED transitions
- **Smart Features:** Auto-date setting, progress calculations, reading session creation
- **Data Integrity:** Transaction management and relationship consistency

**Game Changer:** Automatic book status transitions - when users update progress, the system intelligently changes status and manages dates without manual intervention.

---

### Phase 3: REST API Layer ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**API Implementation:**
- **BookController:** 7 endpoints with full CRUD operations
- **AuthorController:** 8 endpoints with relationship management
- **GenreController:** 8 endpoints with popularity metrics
- **Total:** 23 production-ready REST endpoints

**DTO & Mapper Architecture:**
- **Professional DTO Pattern:** Separate Create/Response DTOs with validation
- **Smart Mappers:** Bidirectional Entity ‚Üî DTO conversion with calculated fields
- **Business Integration:** Progress percentages, relationship counters, status indicators

**Technical Excellence:** Every endpoint follows REST standards with proper HTTP status codes, validation, and error handling.

## üß™ Comprehensive Testing & Validation

### API Testing Results ‚úÖ VERIFIED (15 Postman Tests)

**Core Functionality Tested:**
- **CRUD Operations:** All endpoints creating, reading, updating, deleting successfully
- **Business Logic:** Automatic status transitions working flawlessly
- **Relationships:** Author/Genre associations and bidirectional counting verified
- **Progress Tracking:** Complete workflow from 0% to 100% with session creation
- **Search & Filtering:** Title search and status filtering operational

**Validation & Error Handling:**
- **Input Protection:** Negative pages and excessive values properly rejected (403 Forbidden)
- **Data Integrity:** No corruption from invalid requests
- **Business Rules:** Page limits and status logic enforced

**Real Test Scenarios:**
- Created test data: 3 Authors, 2 Genres, 2 Books in different states
- Verified complete reading workflow: WISHLIST ‚Üí READING ‚Üí FINISHED
- Confirmed automatic date management and session tracking

**Key Success:** The system handles real-world scenarios perfectly - from adding new books to completing reading cycles with intelligent automation.
