## 🧠 Technical Decisions Log

### Database Strategy
**Decision:** H2 for development, PostgreSQL production-ready
**Date:** 20/08/2025
**Reasoning:**
- H2 provides zero-configuration setup for development
- Easy to switch to PostgreSQL for production
- Allows focus on business logic rather than database setup
- Standard practice in Spring Boot development

---

### Architecture Pattern
**Decision:** Layered Architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)
**Date:** 20/08/2025
**Reasoning:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to test individual layers
- Standard Spring Boot pattern
- Scalable and maintainable

---

### Java Version Choice
**Decision:** Java 21 instead of Java 17
**Date:** 20/08/2025
**Reasoning:**
- Java 21 is LTS with support until 2029
- Better performance than Java 17
- Modern language features (pattern matching, records)
- Spring Boot 3.2.x fully supports Java 21

---

### Entity Relationship Strategy
**Decision:** Rich domain model with bidirectional relationships
**Date:** 20/08/2025
**Reasoning:**
- Enables complex queries and data navigation
- Maintains data consistency automatically
- Supports advanced business logic in entities
- Facilitates comprehensive analytics and reporting

---

### Enum Usage for Status Fields
**Decision:** Use enums (BookStatus, ReadingMood) instead of strings
**Date:** 20/08/2025
**Reasoning:**
- Type safety prevents invalid values
- Better IDE support with auto-completion
- Easier refactoring and maintenance
- Can include utility methods for display and logic

---

## 🐛 Issues & Solutions

### Issue #1: Git Merge Conflicts
**Date:** 20/08/2025
**Problem:** Conflicting .gitignore files from GitHub repo and Spring Boot project
**Solution:** Manually merged both versions to include comprehensive coverage
**Learning:** Always review and combine configuration files rather than choosing one

---

### Issue #2: H2 Console Access Blocked
**Date:** 20/08/2025
**Problem:** Spring Security returned 403 Forbidden when accessing H2 Console
**Solution:** Created SecurityConfig with CSRF disabled and frame options enabled
**Learning:** Development security configurations need to balance usability and protection

---

### Issue #3: JPA Relationship Bidirectional Sync
**Date:** 20/08/2025
**Problem:** Understanding how to properly maintain both sides of relationships
**Solution:** Created helper methods (addAuthor, removeAuthor) that update both entities
**Learning:** Bidirectional relationships require manual synchronization for data consistency

---

### Issue #4: Git Push Rejection
**Date:** 20/08/2025
**Problem:** Git rejected push due to remote changes not in local repository
**Solution:** Used git pull to merge remote changes before pushing
**Learning:** Always pull before pushing when working with remote repositories

## 💭 Personal Reflections

### Day 1 Thoughts
Starting this project feels exciting and slightly overwhelming. The key is breaking it down into manageable daily tasks. The structure and planning phase is crucial - time invested now will save hours later. Looking forward to seeing the API come to life over the next 4 weeks.

### Day 2 Thoughts
Today was incredibly productive! Successfully set up the entire Spring Boot environment and created the first entity with comprehensive documentation. The learning curve for JPA annotations was steep but worth it. Seeing the BOOKS table automatically created in H2 Console was very satisfying. The SecurityConfig challenge taught me a lot about development vs production configurations.

### Day 3 Thoughts
**WOW! What an incredible day!** Today I completed the entire data model - something that felt overwhelming at the start is now fully functional. Creating the relationships between entities was like solving a complex puzzle, and seeing all 6 tables appear in H2 Console with proper foreign keys was extremely satisfying.

The most challenging part was understanding bidirectional relationships and ensuring data consistency. The moment when I successfully created an Author, linked it to a Book, and saw the relationship working in both directions was a real breakthrough.

I'm particularly proud of:
- **Complex relationship mapping** - Many-to-Many and One-to-Many working perfectly
- **Rich domain model** - Entities have useful business logic, not just data containers
- **Professional code quality** - Every concept is documented and explained
- **Database design** - 6 tables with proper normalization and constraints

Looking at what I've built, I can see a real library management system taking shape. The ReadingSession entity especially excites me - being able to track reading patterns and mood will make for great analytics later.

**Next milestone:** Repository layer with custom queries. I'm confident and excited to build on this solid foundation!

### Goals Beyond Technical
- Demonstrate professional development practices ✅ **EXCELLENT PROGRESS**
- Create portfolio-worthy project ✅ **DEFINITELY ACHIEVED**
- Build something genuinely useful ✅ **VERY FUNCTIONAL DATA MODEL**
- Learn modern Spring Boot patterns ✅ **ADVANCED CONCEPTS MASTERED**
- Practice comprehensive testing ⏳ **PLANNED FOR WEEK 2**
