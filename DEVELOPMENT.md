## 🧠 Technical Decisions Log

### Database Strategy
**Decision:** H2 for development, PostgreSQL production-ready
**Date:** 20/08/2025
**Reasoning:** 
- H2 provides zero-configuration setup for development
- Easy to switch to PostgreSQL for production
- Allows focus on business logic rather than database setup
- Standard practice in Spring Boot development

---

### Architecture Pattern
**Decision:** Layered Architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)
**Date:** 20/08/2025
**Reasoning:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to test individual layers
- Standard Spring Boot pattern
- Scalable and maintainable

---

### Java Version Choice
**Decision:** Java 21 instead of Java 17
**Date:** 20/08/2025
**Reasoning:**
- Java 21 is LTS with support until 2029
- Better performance than Java 17
- Modern language features (pattern matching, records)
- Spring Boot 3.2.x fully supports Java 21

---

### Security Configuration for Development
**Decision:** Disable CSRF and enable H2 Console access
**Date:** 20/08/2025
**Reasoning:**
- H2 Console requires frame access for its interface
- CSRF tokens interfere with console functionality
- Development environment allows relaxed security
- Properly documented for production changes

---

## 🐛 Issues & Solutions

### Issue #1: Project Planning Complexity
**Date:** 20/08/2025
**Problem:** Initial overwhelm with project scope and requirements
**Solution:** Created detailed 4-week plan with daily breakdowns
**Learning:** Breaking complex projects into small daily tasks makes them manageable

---

### Issue #2: Git Merge Conflicts
**Date:** 20/08/2025
**Problem:** Conflicting .gitignore files from GitHub repo and Spring Boot project
**Solution:** Manually merged both versions to include comprehensive coverage
**Learning:** Always review and combine configuration files rather than choosing one

---

### Issue #3: H2 Console Access Blocked
**Date:** 20/08/2025
**Problem:** Spring Security returned 403 Forbidden when accessing H2 Console
**Solution:** Created SecurityConfig with CSRF disabled and frame options enabled
**Learning:** Development security configurations need to balance usability and protection

## 💭 Personal Reflections

### Day 1 Thoughts
Starting this project feels exciting and slightly overwhelming. The key is breaking it down into manageable daily tasks. The structure and planning phase is crucial - time invested now will save hours later. Looking forward to seeing the API come to life over the next 4 weeks.

### Day 2 Thoughts
Today was incredibly productive! Successfully set up the entire Spring Boot environment and created the first entity with comprehensive documentation. The learning curve for JPA annotations was steep but worth it. Seeing the BOOKS table automatically created in H2 Console was very satisfying. The SecurityConfig challenge taught me a lot about development vs production configurations. Looking forward to creating the relationships between entities tomorrow.

### Goals Beyond Technical
- Demonstrate professional development practices ✅ ON TRACK
- Create portfolio-worthy project ✅ ON TRACK
- Build something genuinely useful ✅ ON TRACK
- Learn modern Spring Boot patterns ✅ PROGRESSING WELL
- Practice comprehensive testing ⏳ PLANNED FOR WEEK 2
